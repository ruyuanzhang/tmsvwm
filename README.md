# TMSVWM
This is the matlab code repository for TMS visual working memory (TMVWM) project. The main contributor for this project is [Ru-Yuan Zhang](ruyuanzhang@gmail.com), Hao-Jiang Ying, and Fei Wang.

## History
* 2019/07/01 RZ created the github repository


## Instructions of running experiments
### Preparation
1. Please download utility functions from [RZutil](https://github.com/ruyuanzhang/RZutil), and add the functions to your matlab path.

2. Make sure you have the proper measure of your monitor. The key factor is ***scale_factor***, which indicates how many acrmin in one screen pixel.

### Running experiment
1. For each run, simply type below to run the experiment. It needs to input the number of stimuli (e.g., 1,3,4,6)

	```matlab
	>>VWM_rect_new_rz.m
	Please input the number of stimuli: 3
	```


2. Data will be automatically saved with time stamp.
